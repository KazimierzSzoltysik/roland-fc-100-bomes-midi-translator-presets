# roland-fc-100-bomes-midi-translator-presets

Back around 2009, I was a poor kid who couldn't afford decent equipment for my music studio. I came across some material on the Internet, which showed that you can very inexpensively rebuild Roland hardware.

I bought the device for 50 euros and spent a lot of time writing scripts that turned the foot controller from a device that sent only CC messages into a full-fledged MIDI controller.

Today, after years I found those files and decided to share them with the world completely free of charge. Maybe someone will find them useful :)

I give no guarantee that it will work. You run it at your own risk XD
